Find my PYTHON & SQL(MSSQL) CODES HERE....


SQL(SSMS)
-  COVID DATA SQL QUERY file showcases my sql querying skills. I joined two files(Covid_deaths and covid_vaccinations) to achieve the desired goal. 

-  In the "DeliverAgency" sql file, data cleaning techniques were deployed using SQL language on the xlsx file(DeliveryAgency).



PYTHON(Jupyter notebook)
- The python file(LOTA PYTHON...) shows excellent data cleaning and correlation(Pearson) skills with python libraries like Pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib. The "movies.csv" file was imported for this approach
